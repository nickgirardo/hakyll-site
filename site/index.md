## About

I'm a New York-based software engineer.
I've spent most of my career thus far doing full-stack and front-end web development.
For more details on that, check out [my resume](./resume.pdf).

Other recent technical interests of mine include graphics programming, constraint systems, and reproducibility.
This website uses Nix to ensure that its builds are reproducible.

I am currently interested in full-time or consulting work.
If you are interested in working with me, you can reach me at [nickgirardo@gmail.com](mailto:nickgirardo@gmail.com).
