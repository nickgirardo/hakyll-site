## About

I'm a software engineer based out of New York.
I primarily work in full-stack and front-end web development.
For more details on my past work, check out [my resume](./resume.pdf).
You can also find more things I've done on [my GitHub](https://github.com/nickgirardo).

My other technical interests include constraint systems, build systems, and embedded programming.
This website uses Nix to fetch external dependecies and ensure reproduciblity.
You can check out some of my other projects [here](./projects.html).

I've been wanting to write more about my experiences with computing and programming.
My latest post is a recounting of my experiences developing ["A Very Hard Game"](/a-very-hard-game/index.html) for the [GameTank](https://gametank.zone/).
You can read it [here](/post/avhg-thoughts.html).

I serve as a member on the board of [HackManhattan](https://hackmanhattan.com/), Manhattans's Public Makerspace.
HackManhattan is a non-profit, all-volunteer hackerspace.
If you find yourself in New York on a Tuesday or Thursday night, please come visit our open house!

I am currently looking for full-time or consulting work.
If you are interested in working with me, you can reach me at [nickgirardo@gmail.com](mailto:nickgirardo@gmail.com).
