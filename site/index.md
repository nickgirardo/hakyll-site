## About

I'm a software engineer based out of New York.
I primarily work in full-stack and front-end web development.
For more details on my past work, check out [my resume](./resume.pdf).
You can also find more things I've done on [my GitHub](https://github.com/nickgirardo).

My other technical interests include graphics programming, constraint systems, and reproducibility.
This website uses Nix to fetch external dependecies and ensure reproduciblity.
You can check out some of my other projects [here](./projects.html).

I serve as a member on the board of [HackManhattan](https://hackmanhattan.com/), Manhattans's Public Makerspace.
HackManhattan is a non-profit, all-volunteer hackerspace.
If you find yourself in New York on a Tuesday or Thursday night, please come visit our open house!

I am currently looking for full-time or consulting work.
If you are interested in working with me, you can reach me at [nickgirardo@gmail.com](mailto:nickgirardo@gmail.com).
