    <h3>Trone</h3>
    <div class="project-body">
        <p>A minimalist kanban tool.</p>
        <p>
            I had wanted to use a kanban tool to better keep myself organized, but I found the bells and whistles of tools like Trello and Planka distracting.
            Furthermore, most commercial tools do not allow users to control their own data, and even open source self-hosted alternatives tend to have complicated database setups.
        </p>
        <p>
            I designed this tool with my own preferences in mind.
            All but the bare minimum features have been removed, and data is stored locally in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB</a>
            (with basic import/ export functionality).
        </p>
        <p>
            Storing data locally in the browser is not without its drawbacks. The current approach to data storage makes cross-device data syncing impossible.
            In the future, I'd like to experiment with a "Bring Your Own Storage" sort of approach, where users can locally store keys to their own block storage (e.g. S3).
            This should allow for data syncing without entirely relinquishing control of one's data at the cost of potentially involved setup.

<div id="sudoku" class="project">
    <h3>Sudoku</h3>
    <div class="project-body">
        <p>
            A fairly basic implementation of a Sudoku puzzle player and builder.
        </p>
        <p>
            What makes this project interesting is that puzzles are stored in the query string.
            Therefore, users can share their levels as normal hyperlinks without a need for the puzzles to be stored on any server.
            Even the static page where the puzzle is played could in theory be replaced by any static page implementing the same logic of decoding the puzzle
            (described <a href="https://github.com/nickgirardo/sudoku?tab=readme-ov-file#decoding-and-encoding-v1-puzzles">here</a>).

<div id="context-play-pause" class="project">
    <h3>Context Play/ Pause</h3>
    <div class="project-body">
        <p>
            A simple WebExtension allowing users to play or pause a tab's video from the tab's context menu.
            This was made before a change in Firefox which allowed users to control videos similarly with function keys.
            This significantly reduced the need for the WebExtension, but I still find myself using it from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
            This WebExtension will require an update to Manifest V3 in the near future to continue functioning, but I have thus far
            been quite happy with and impressed by how little maintenance has been required for its continued functioning.
